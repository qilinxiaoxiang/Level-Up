## 🔧 Key Database Features

### Automatic Profile Creation
New users automatically get a profile with default stats and preferences.

### Real-Time Status Calculation
Daily task "Done today" status is calculated in real-time from pomodoro sessions. No persistence needed - status reflects actual time logged since last day cut.

### Row Level Security
All data is isolated per user - you can only access your own tasks, goals, and progress.

## 📊 Database Schema

Complete schema available in `database/schema.sql`, including:
- `user_profiles` - User preferences and streak tracking
- `goals` - 3-tier goal system
- `tasks` - Daily and one-time tasks
- `task_relationships` - Links between one-time and daily tasks
- `pomodoros` - Completed work sessions (source of truth for time tracking)
- `active_pomodoros` - Current running sessions

**Note**: Run `database/cleanup-rewards-and-daily-completions.sql` on existing databases to remove deprecated tables and columns.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

**The Loop**: Set Goals → Complete Tasks → Track Progress → Maintain Streaks → Achieve More

The app provides structure and motivation for productivity without gamification distractions. It's designed to:
- Make task completion visible and measurable
- Visualize long-term progress with real-time statistics
- Encourage consistent daily habits with streak tracking
- Provide flexible goal setting with 3-tier timeline
- Balance work with rest (via rest credits and customizable day cut)

## 🔨 Development Guidelines

When making changes to this project, please follow these guidelines:

### Responsive Design
- **Always test on both mobile and desktop** - Check layout, interactions, and usability on different screen sizes
- Use responsive Tailwind classes (sm:, md:, lg:) appropriately
- Test touch interactions on mobile devices

### Version Control
- **Always `git push` after modifications** - Keep the remote repository up to date
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages

### Documentation
- **Record significant changes in README.md** - Add concise notes about new features or important modifications
- **Update existing documentation** - When features change, update the corresponding sections in README.md
- Keep change descriptions brief but informative

### Database Changes
- **Modify `database/schema.sql` first** - This is the source of truth for the complete schema
- **Create separate DDL migration files** - Add incremental migration files under `database/` folder with descriptive names (e.g., `database/add-overtime-tracking.sql`)
- **CRITICAL: Update `frontend/src/types/database.ts`** - Always update TypeScript type definitions after DDL changes. Vercel deployment will fail if types don't match the database schema
- This approach facilitates applying changes to existing databases without re-running the entire schema
